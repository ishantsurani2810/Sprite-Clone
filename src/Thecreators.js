                Sage Guillory is a transformative artist from Atlanta, GA. In
                his childhood, Sage felt like he didn’t fit in anywhere which
                led to him perusing art and self enlightenment on his own terms.
                After leaving art school, he cultivated his creative vision
                through various mediums, and has centered most of his works in
                illustration, painting, and graphic design. Perseverance and
                dedication to his craft are the foundational elements of Sage's
                creations.

                Foremost is a self-taught visual artist who uses digital,
                collage, and illustrative mediums to center Blackness in his
                work. Seemingly simple, Foremost produces narratives aimed at
                challenging Black folks to rethink what it means to be Black as
                it relates to state violence and racial disparity. At the edge
                of his work, Foremost explores themes of limitless Black love,
                Black imagination, and Black freedom. He is the lead artist and
                youth facilitator of Black Lives Matter: Los Angeles.
